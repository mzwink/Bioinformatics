#### April 14 Class

Independent Projects

---

Independent report - each get a transcriptome

Work on annotation and gene expression

Look at transcriptome papers

---

ideas/description:

	Transcript #

	Transcript length (contig)
	
	GC content
	
	How complete: transrate (n50 value, estimate of quality)
	
Assembly

	SOAP denovo - gives 30-60 thousand contigs
	
	Looks for overlaps	

Given the assembled transcriptome

	Get FASTA file
	
	2 files with the reads (paired end reads)
	
Annotation

	Command line BLAST --> .xml files --> BLAST2GO
	
	Put sequences into gene ontology
	
	Compare to model species
	
	Figure out gene expression
	
	
Take contigs from the assembly and align the smaller reads back to it to determine gene expression

	High counts = high expression
	Expression is related to abundance of sequence
	
	Visualizing into figures and tables
	
Look into primary literature - come to conclusion about what these results mean

Use Rstudio, edgeR for differential expression

Look at transrate next week

Make outlines of what we should do and what example code I should look at
