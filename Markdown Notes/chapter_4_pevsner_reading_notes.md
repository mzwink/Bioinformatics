### Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)

BLAST searching allows the user to select one sequence (query) and perform pairwise sequence alignments between the query and the entire database and only the closely related matches are returned.

BLAST searches are used for:

- Determining what orthologs and paralogs are known for a particular protein or nucleic acid sequence

- Determining what proteins or genes are present in a particular organism

- Determining the identity of a DNA or protein sequence

- Discovering new genes

- Determining what variants have been described for a particular gene or protein

- Investigating expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that may exhibit alternative splicing

- Exploring amino acid residues that are important in the function and/or structure of a protein
