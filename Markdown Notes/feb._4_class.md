### Unix Commands

*mv* - will move folders and can also use it to rename files

	mv file.txt newfile.txt
	
	Move things or rename them
	
*touch* - create new files if they don't exist

*man* - to see manual and to see more about a command

	man touch
	
*cp* - copy command


### BLAST

- Used on blast from chapter 3 of Bioinformatics Data Skills on tg1-protein.fasta

Teosinte branched 1 protein, partial [Zea mays subsp. mays]

	Accession: ACI43554

	Version: ACI43554.1 GI: 209362238
	
	Source/Organism: Zea mays subsp. mays (maize)
	
	Reference: Patterns of molecular evolution associated with two selective sweeps in the Tb1-Dwarf8 region in maize
	
	
Tb1 -  deals with major maize domestication

	Function: Transcription factor. Involved in apical dominance. Represses the growth of axillary organs (lateral branches), but enables formation of femal inflorescences. Regulates the number and length of axillary branches.

- Study focused on Tb1 and Dwarf8 to investigate the consequences of two closely linked selective sweeps on nucleotide variation to gain insights into√ü maize geographical diffusion, through climate adaptation

- Analyzed patterns of nucleotide variation at Tb1, D8, and seven short regions in the Tb1-D8 region

- Selection on these genes leads to early-flowering time in tropical lines due to consistency of polymorphism pattern with the sweeps at Tb1 and D8
