_De Novo Assembly and Annotation of the Transcriptome of the Agricultural Weed Ipomoea purpurea Uncovers Gene Expression Changes Associated with Herbicide Resistance_Trent Leslie and Regina Baucom

---Evolution of herbicide resistance in weedy plants is one of the most well-known examples of rapid, human-induced evolution
Glyphosate resistance have been characterized in a handful of species 
Some species exhibit low-level resistance to herbicide application
A fully annotated transcriptome and use this referenceto examine the early gene expression differences of herbicide resistant selection lines after herbicide application
_Transcripts that show consistent gene expression changes after artifical selection are candidate genes that affect the selected trait_

	Deepen understanding of the gene expression changes that accompany direct and correlated changes after artificial selection for resistance to herbicide.
	
	1) Provide a thorough functional annotation to the proteins expressed in the transcriptome
	2) examine the prevalence and diversity of the cytochrome P450 genes - known to provide a role in xenobiotic metabolism in gene plants
	3) Examine gene expression changes of artificially diverged herbicide resistant selection lines using this reference transcriptome
	4) Validate gene expression differences using quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR)	Overall want to what causes the phenotypic variation
