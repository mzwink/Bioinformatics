_De Novo Assembly and Annotation of the Transcriptome of the Agricultural Weed Ipomoea purpurea Uncovers Gene Expression Changes Associated with Herbicide Resistance_Trent Leslie and Regina Baucom

---Evolution of herbicide resistance in weedy plants is one of the most well-known examples of rapid, human-induced evolution
Glyphosate resistance have been characterized in a handful of species 
Some species exhibit low-level resistance to herbicide application
A fully annotated transcriptome and use this referenceto examine the early gene expression differences of herbicide resistant selection lines after herbicide application
